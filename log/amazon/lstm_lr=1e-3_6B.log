Sentence: sensationalist trash this is really a pile of garbage . a man decides to trash the people he worked with and ends up with so much attention . it s so sad because some of the people he talks about are simply brilliant . yes many things go wrong is the investment banking financial engineering industry but many things go wrong in any work place . what i find sad is that the book has attracted so much attention in the financial press well those columnists need something to fill their columns with and some of the stories that partnoy has to say are gripping which gives the whole subject an unnecessarily bad name .

Sentence: what you don t know can t hurt you . right ok ok he s no michael lewis . but partnoy offers a painless and very entertaining way to learn something about derivatives without bringing along your calculator . it is hardly news to anyone involved in investment banking that salespeople regard their clients as complete oafs while imagining themselves to be masters of the universe . but even lewis did not show it as cruelly and with such timeliness as this book does . the other important point that he makes that banks keep up their profitability by inventing securities that are one step more complicated than the buyers can analyze with their bloomberg machines is an important one for policy analysts . this should be required reading at the sec and federal reserve bank of ny .

Sentence: overrated letdown this is a prime example of an overrated film which is essentially a letdown made up of an inane plot and near zero budget which explains why there is basically no special effects worth mentioning and a darned cheesy monster costume in the show .thankfully this film has been out of production for a really longggg time and that fact alone tells you that it does not deserve your moolahs . stick with the 1982 version by john carpenter . that is a real classic .

Sentence: real classics hundreds of sci fi films were made from 1950 to 1980 . few are real classics . a classic film to me is 1 has an original script not a rehash of an earlier film . we all know what i mean when you compare jaws to jaws 2 3 . 4 . the aalien and matrix series.2 enough character development so you care what happens to them 3 rely more on imagination then special effects 4 you enjoy it every time you watch it among other criteria . in my opinion some of the 1950 1970 classics include the thing original the incredible shrinking man forget the dull spin offs the amazing collosal man attack of the 50 ft . woman who doesn t attack anything but the bar that her husband is in getting drunk them war of the worlds the day the earth stood still when worlds collide and others that i can t recall right now .

Sentence: interesting story of life in a small ship during a major war not a lot of action in this one . still it was interesting . i guess that if you are following the career a a naval officer over his lifetime there will be a point where he is not actually in the middle of the fight . this book was one of those . hornblower has been given a secret mission to recover the payroll of the invasion fleet of the previous year . there are four tons of gold and silver . the government is badly in need of fres cash . the treasure lies on the bottom under 110 feet of water inside of a ship that capsized and sank upside down . to accomplish this mission hornblower has been given an expert in slavage and three pearl divers from india ... enough about the story . the book was well written . the hardships of the officers and men of a small ship far from home and away from the fleet . good reading . this is a part of naval life that is seldom written about .

Sentence: an excellent book about what really happens in the mind this book is about friendship and its hardships . gene and intellectual envies phineas because of his athletic ability . ironically they are the best of friends . unfortunately their friendship becomes a roller coaster after an important event . read a separate peace to find out what happens to their friendship . i think john knowles wrote this book for adults . this book shows the redaer the effects of war . by reading a separate peace they may want to work out their problems before taking action . also there are many people that the book refers to from world war ii . younger readers have probably never heard of these people . even though there are these complications this is an excellent book . i recommend it to people of all ages who know the struggles of friendship .

Sentence: if you re not being forced to read this don t. after reading this book and realizing it was required in many american schools i had to wonder what was coming to the world . how can any decent school subject their students to this piece of trash this was a horrible novel knowels use of first person through gene should have made me feel closer to this character but did not succeed . instead it gave me a feeling of disconnectedness from other characters and made me truly feel like an outsider looking in and wishing desperatly to turn away . this book was not only easy to put down it was hard to pick back up again . although difficult i succeeded in completing the novel . throughout the entire story the plot had seemed basic and annoyingly predictable . it seems as though knowels threw finny s death in at the end of the book not for closure but as a vain attempt to convince the reader that they can not see through the story . this was a waste of my time .

Sentence: the wrong question this is an excellent novel well written throughout funny at times and ultimately tragic and insightful at the end . many previous reviews are asking the wrong question . it is not relevant if gene jostled the tree with malice or not . i think it was pretty clear in the book that gene was filled with paranoia jealousy and mixed emotions leading up to that point and from his point of view even he does not fully understand why he did it . however this issue is really just a precursor to a more significant issue how gene is unable to reconcile his feelings and express his regret to finny . each time the two talk about what happened they are left as stuttering fools and at the times when gene talks to leper and brinker gene denies his actions out of guilt and as a result is unable to just get the whole ordeal off his chest . in fact as the story progresses it is clear that his suppressed emotions and inability to resolve them lead directly to the tragic ending . great book .

Sentence: predictable in multiple ways if you ve read the book then you ll probably agree that there are a lot of original elements to the story . unfortunately as very frequently happens when books are turned into movies all the originality was sucked out of the plot ... maybe for the sake of easy money . or maybe because the producers thought they could do better . sort of arrogant considering that i am legend is a classic . anyway if you liked the book and are similarly irritated when that kind of thing happens then don t depress yourself by watching this movie . if you aren t bothered by predictable storylines though and just want something with action in it then you ll probably like it .

Sentence: very bad can you give a film negative stars cage is not my favorite actor but he really under does himself in this one . the script fancies itself to be clever but it s just boring . there s no logical flow to the story . the banal plot twists are totally predictable unimaginative and just don t make any logical sense . the music is contrived and not very original . it is possible to deal with a disturbing subject in an imaginative and artistic way but this movie isn t even close to either . if you never see this film you will be a better person for it .

Sentence: great literary beauty sabotaged by horrible attempts at pseudoscience this is a collection of short stories based on scientific theories . however this attempt to give pseudo scientific explanations settings to all the stories spoils the general fable like literary beauty and charm of these stories . i don t claim that science fiction should be held to the same standards of rigour and correctness as science itself but stories that require suspension of disbelief douglas adams hitchhiker s guide or lem s cyberiad should not try to explain things within the realm of actual science . such stories can develop their own internal self consistent logical systems but if they try to connect to actual science then they merely become inconsistent . it is sad to see good literature being wrecked by bad science .

Sentence: horrible blue ray transfer exactly why anyone would bother to put a film of this poor quality out on a blu ray disc completely evades me . the video quality and audio quality are both unbelievably bad . i purchase blu ray discs at least partly for the experience provided by the normally outstanding video and audio quality of the discs themselves . the movie itself has the feel of the cheap made for television flick that is is although i don t ever recall seeing a movie of any sort of this recent a vintage that both looked and sounded so bad . the production of this film is 80 s cheese at its worst . the color is terrible . if the blu ray is this poor i can t imagine how bad it must have been in other formats . i have vhs tapes created using the slowest recording speed that look better than this on the big screen . the quality is so poor it really should come with a warning on the label . avoid this one .

Sentence: ignore this see the original instead my theory is that ole bornedal whose 1994 danish language original nattevagten was an instant classic of the serial killer suspense genre was shown a large sum of to force out this turgid soulless remake . it s almost a shot by shot line by line retelling of the familiar whodunit with a law student the uncomfortable ewan mcgregor being menaced by a serial killer during his nightwatch at a medical building . the character shading smooth flow of events and atmospheric chills have been replaced at the expense of visual finesse and inexplicable character motivation . style over substance much in the vein of those melarkey scream films and more than likely to snare in the kiddies . my two star rating is based solely on the stylish re creations of a few scenes plus admirable performances from nick nolte and josh brolin who give the dense material their all . but my advice is to avoid this version altogether and stick with the real deal .

Sentence: fun fun fun but breaks easily this game is a blast if it doesn t break . i played it with my 5 year old for about 30 minutes before it broke . we sent it back and amazon got us another one very fast . second toy hasn t broken yet . basically you move your scooby character through the game and if the spinner lands on a ghost you press a spring loaded ghost on top of the game . the ghost turns some gears inside the game and randomly activates traps which can do various things to your character very fun . the ghost on top is what broke so that it popped back up violently and would send your scooby flying across the room .... still funny but not the way it s supposed to work . furthermore it broke with an adult operating the game . i can t imagine this will hold up with unsupervised kids playing it . bottom line it s super cheap chinese made garbage but it s also really fun ... worth the risk for 15 20 .

Sentence: i did not like this book at all . i was supremely excited to last week to find that anne rice s newest novel violin was at my local public library . i checked it out and took it home . i sat down in my favorite chair to begin reading it as i had done with all of the other anne rice books that i had read and loved . but as i began with the proem something seemed wrong to me . i think i read about 20 pages before i was thoroughly disgusted with its lack of action and complete abstraction . i could make no sense of the latest work by one of my favorite authors . the book sat around for about a week before i returned it today unread .

Sentence: facts and figures about the gop the history contained in this book goes through 2003 . there are few books as good as this one in explaining how the gop came about from the death of the whig party to its mercurial persistence since reconstruction . usually university professors write about republicans in open polemic . gould has attempts to write as unbiased a history as possible because he sticks to recognizable or generally agreed upon facts . it is actually an exciting read it is not a dull academic paper because the professor develops his chapters into known chronological epochs of american political history .

Sentence: lucky you if you have a taste for truly original horror stories stories such that you will never anticipate where the tale is going until its over stories that you will probably never forget then how i envy you if you haven t yet read robert aickman . discovering his stories was one of my pleasantest surprises in reading . these strange tales go beyond surreal . they seem to me to mine some source that predates civilization and its armor against forces felt to be sinister and inhuman . there is a rich literary flavor to many of these stories but that is only a sort of backdrop that doesn t interfere with the telling . also they have a distinctly english flavor which seems to go hand in glove with the subject matter . in my estimation aickman was the master of the horror genre and a strong contender among writers of fine literature in general .

Sentence: one of the couple decent dimmu albums i m going to keep it short . this album is melodic and atmospheric . this album does every right where the later dimmu albums do everything wrong . the lyrics are great and have a majestic feeling when combined with the music . the problem with this album is that it s too damn cheesy . but it s great to listen to by yourself . dimmu borgir once was a decent band where there was talented vocals without 50 special effects being used on them . i d suggest you check out stormblast if you like this album but listening to that you ve pretty much listened to everything dimmu has had to offer .

Sentence: dvd quality poor storyline poor i am a crawford fan and also enjoy old b w movies . but this is just so boring to watch and you wonder why they bothered going on location to catalina island all you mostly see is the stage stuff anyway . the film apparently got bad reviews when it was first released and crawford herself said if she could have re done it she would have as the overall film lacked spark she also referred to her own acting as too over the top . this is one of her worst films in my opinion yet it was one of the first they released on dvd . why not release the good ones first like mildred pierce what s wrong with movie companies the quality of this dvd is also really bad despite my copy saying digitally remastered from the original print . it was so poor that it kept fading in and out . for the collectors of oldies only . sorry the review could not be more positive but i do nt want you wasting money on a bad product .

Sentence: books don t necessarily translate well into movies i really liked the concept . it s why i rented the movie . but the movie itself was pretty rotten . as others have said the production value was bottom of the barrel and the acting wasn t that great either . i normally enjoy watching john billingsley . however in this movie he really annoyed me . that s not entirely the actors fault though . i think the problem was the attempt to simply take a book and put it on screen with no adjustment for the medium . this movie is literally just a bunch of people sitting around in a cabin . they are talking . that s the action . if i were reading the dialog rather than suffering through watching it i probably would have enjoyed the heck out of it . i was expecting something like highlander at least in terms of some period flashbacks . i kept waiting . but all i got was talk .

Sentence: over produced un original all songs sound the same ... without doubt the newsboys are one of christian music s premier bands with an enormous following throughout the world . their influence has been far reaching and very positive . i guess i m buttering them up so i can say ... this cd is bad ... really bad . i was very excited to hear that a sequel to not ashamed was released . so i rushed to the nearest christian bookstore and wasted 15 on a boring every song sounds the same un original over produced recording that never should have been written . if there is a bright spot on this cd well ... i wasn t able to find one . i can t even recommend this cd to die hard newsboys fans because i think it is so bad . spend your 15 bucks on something better like not ashamed .

Sentence: my daughter s new favorite obsession everyone in the family loves this movie . the emphasis is on high energy dancing and singing as it should be the young cast is superlative and the old movie stars travolta and pfieffer good and walken only slightly distracting he s miscast as the sweetest hubby in town . although it s silly and superficial the treatment of integration is still highly preferrable to a plot about a thwarted romance or a misplaced bundle of money or the usual teenertainment . my eleven year old daughter is obsessed she can t stop the beat girl lead girl power and nothing at all about shopping

Sentence: disappointing remake of retro dance movie hollywood should have left the original version alone the remake is just awful and loses the spirit of the play . it is full of energy and starts out fresh but soon gets bogged down with a overdoing a heavy message on racism which the first movie kept in perspective for a light and fluffy teen musical . it was fun to look back through rose colored glasses at 1962 and overall simplistic view of the times . the first movie was better even though this version of hairspray was fun seeing john travolta in drag .

Sentence: some things should be left alone ... the best part of this movie is that it s eventually over i was very excited when i found out about the remake . i thought it would be a fantastic twist to see a great story turned into a musical . then i watched it . john travolta does a fantastic sly stallone impersonation he doesn t utter one audible word trying to replicate the character divine made legendary . first pull an all star cast together and none of them get to show their own personalities rather just mimic the orignal cast . next make nonsense out of the story line just to add a lot of painful musical numbers that are vaguely remeniscent of the 1960 s. finally take the serious racial issues made clear in the original version and just making shock value . the result is disaster . if you like this movie i suggest you rent or buy the original version you ll be plesantly surpised . if you haven t bought this movie don t waste your money . if i could rate this with a negative star i would .

Sentence: unexpected divas though pfeiffer latifah simply continue to maintain their status as musical and entertainment goddesses travolta has proven his versatility and talent in this movie by becoming a diva in his own right . nikki blonsky is a delight . i adore her ... she is the ricky lake for the 21st century . in the tradition of the sound of music grease and other great musicals hairspray is both a cliche and timeless . i will be enjoying this movie for years to come

Sentence: loved it i didn t think i d be interested in this movie but i ended up absoutely loving it . i ve never seen the play so it was completely new to me . i loved the music and the humor . this is a movie that will put you in a good mood for sure . all the lead characters were great but for me it was the supporting characters that really made this a great movie . james marsden amanda bynes michelle pfeiffer and others were all great i did feel though that john travolta was miscast . he doesn t have a good singing voice and he seemed to be trying to be mike myers . if they re going to have a male for the role i think myers would have be perfect for it . but travolta was still good .
